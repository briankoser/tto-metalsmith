Brian likes listening to podcasts and making top ten lists. He thinks this qualifies him to co-host a podcast. We’ll see.

Melissa is the Yin to Brian’s Yang, the light to his darkness (and vice versa). She usually helps bring balance to his ideas, except when she’s wholeheartedly jumping on board with them.
