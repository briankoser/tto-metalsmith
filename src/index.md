Welcome to Ten to One, the podcast where we make top ten lists about everything!

<h2>News - 2016-09-08</h2>
We’re about to leave on our first big vacation since Lydia was born (please like air travel please like air travel). We recorded episodes 15-17 ahead of time to avoid missing a week, but a technical difficulty led to us losing episode 16. ☹ So, we’re going to release episode 15 at the normal time next Friday night, then there’ll be a 2-3 week gap before episode 16. Talk to you then!
