The easiest way to listen to a podcast is to subscribe with an app. The app will automatically download and alert you when a new episode is available. Hereâ€™s how:

# Android

Download a podcast player app. [BeyondPod](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.beyondpod&hl=en) has a free version; you can always pay for [BeyondPod Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.beyondpod.unlockkey&hl=en) or [Pocket Casts](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.shiftyjelly.pocketcasts) later if you need additional features.
2. Find feed.
3. Subscribe.
4. Episodes should now download automatically.
